# Introduction {#introduction}

The `bookdown` package and [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html) is definitely the best way to get started. However, in practice I always find myself copying an existing, working book and modifying it instead of starting from scratch. So this tutorial is going to have you do that as well, using this book as the one you copy from.

You will have to name your book's repository. To differentiate your book's repo name from this "bookdown-tutorial" repo, here we'll call your book "awesome-book" *but you should consistently name it what you want to name it*.

## Benefits of a centralised data repository for soil data.


A centralised data repository for soil data offers a multitude of benefits, spanning from enhanced accessibility and data sharing to improved data quality and informed decision-making.

* Accessibility: A single repository provides a unified access point for various stakeholders, including researchers, farmers, policymakers, and educators, facilitating easy retrieval of information. Centralization promotes interdisciplinary research and collaboration by making soil data accessible across different scientific and agricultural disciplines.
* Quality: A centralised data repository ensures that data from various sources is standardised in format, making it easier to compare and analyse and providing better control over the quality of soil data, as it can be vetted and validated through standardised protocols.
* Efficient Data Management: Centralised repositories provide organised storage, making it easier to manage vast amounts of soil data efficiently. Central repositories ensure long-term preservation of soil data, protecting it from loss due to localised issues like technical failures or organisational changes.
* Improved Data Analysis and Research: Having a centralised repository means researchers can access more comprehensive data sets, leading to more robust and inclusive research outcomes. Centralization facilitates the application of advanced data analytics, including AI and machine learning, to uncover deeper insights and patterns in soil data.
* Support for Policy and Decision Making: Access to comprehensive soil data aids policymakers in developing informed, evidence-based agricultural and environmental policies. This support can be crucial in managing risks related to agriculture, such as soil degradation, contamination, and climate change impacts.
* Enhanced Educational and Outreach Opportunities: A centralised soil data repository serves as an invaluable resource for educational institutions, enhancing learning and research opportunities for students.and it can also play a role in raising public awareness about soil health and sustainable agricultural practices.
* Facilitation of Digital Initiatives: Centralised data repositories are essential for digital soil mapping initiatives, providing the necessary data to create detailed and accurate soil maps. They facilitate the integration of soil data with other technological tools, like GIS and remote sensing, enhancing the scope of soil analysis and interpretation.
* Global Collaboration and Benchmarking: A centralised repository can serve as a platform for international collaboration, sharing best practices and data across borders. It allows for benchmarking and comparative studies at a global scale, essential for understanding and addressing global soil health issues.

A centralised data repository for soil data is a powerful tool that can transform how soil information is managed and utilised. By providing a platform for standardised, high-quality, and accessible soil data, it supports a range of activities from scientific research to policy making, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and informed management of soil resources worldwide.
