	abstract = {Legacy soil data have been produced over 70 years in nearly all countries of the world. Unfortunately, data, information and knowledge are still currently fragmented and at risk of getting lost if they remain in a paper format. To process this legacy data into consistent, spatially explicit and continuous global soil information, data are being rescued and compiled into databases. Thousands of soil survey reports and maps have been scanned and made available online. The soil profile data reported by these data sources have been captured and compiled into databases. The total number of soil profiles rescued in the selected countries is about 800,000. Currently, data for 117, 000 profiles are compiled and harmonized according to GlobalSoilMap specifications in a world level database (WoSIS). The results presented at the country level are likely to be an underestimate. The majority of soil data is still not rescued and this effort should be pursued. The data have been used to produce soil property maps. We discuss the pro and cons of top-down and bottom-up approaches to produce such maps and we stress their complementarity. We give examples of success stories. The first global soil property maps using rescued data were produced by a top-down approach and were released at a limited resolution of 1km in 2014, followed by an update at a resolution of 250m in 2017. By the end of 2020, we aim to deliver the first worldwide product that fully meets the GlobalSoilMap specifications.},

	n2 = {The development and implementation of a national data schema for soil data in Australia over the last two decades, coupled with advances in information technology, has led to the realisation of more comprehensive state and national soil databases. This has facilitated increased access to soil data for many purposes, including the creation of many digital soil-mapping products, such as the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia. Consequently, users of soil data have a growing need for clarity concerning the quality of the data; many new users have little understanding of the varying quality of the data. To date, statements about the quality of primary soil data have typically been qualitative and/or judgemental rather than explicit. The consequences of poor-quality primary data and of the lack of a coding system for data quality are growing with increased usage and with demand for soil data at the regional to national scale. Pillar 4 of the Global Soil Partnership and the National Soil Research, Development and Extension Strategy both identify the need to improve the quality of soil data. Various international standards do exist with respect to the quality of soil data but these tend to focus on general principles and quality-assurance frameworks rather than the detail of describing data quality. The aim of this paper is to stimulate a discussion in the Australian soil science community on how to quantify and describe the quality of primary soil data. We provide examples of the data quality issues and propose a framework for structured data-quality checking procedures and quality coding of soil morphological and analytical data in Australia.},

	abstract = {Legacy databases provide unique information on soil properties and act as a guide for the setup of monitoring processes. However, their use requires an evaluation of their drawbacks, especially when aiming to model the soil traits by depth. We set up a procedure for the integration and error correction of a soil legacy database. This database consisted of 6994 records in its original form and 6674 records after correction. These records were collected from 2886 locations in the south of Italy on a 25,711-km2 island (Sicily, Italy). Samples were taken in arable lands (5471 records), orchards, vineyards and seminatural lands (3010 records), and woodland and natural areas (1203 records). The procedure for the integration and error highlighting improved the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC), and a general linear model with covariate selection by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) tested the procedure. We focussed on exploring the amount of legacy information as georeferenced soil properties. SOC and fine earth fractions were analysed for each sample. Bulk density was provided for only 20% of the samples. These results will help to account for the legacy data available and propose an analysis to harmonize an SOC dataset; highlight missing or incorrect data; summarize data; and offer synthesis criteria for benchmarking SOC in different land uses and pedological areas. In addition, the results may stimulate funding bodies to support research in an open data frame, which can be turned into more sustainable use of resources, improved communication between governments and farmers, and the production of standard datasets that meet and facilitate the requirements for regional agro-environmental modelling.},

	abstract = {Nowadays there is an increasing effort for raising global awareness for the importance of soils to ensure food security, to improve agricultural and environmental planning and monitoring, and to establish effective and sustainable land management policies to counteract soil degradation. This study presents the INFOSOLO legacy database as the first effort to develop a soil information system in Portugal, suitable to compile soil data produced in the country, and to support stakeholders and land managers in decision-making. The database currently includes soil data from a set of 9934 horizons/layers studied in 3461 soil profiles across the country between 1966 and 2014. Data was extracted from scattered soil surveys, research projects, and academic studies carried out by public Portuguese and other European institutions, with a series of validation tests and harmonization procedures being implemented in order to access and improve the quality of the data. The importance of the INFOSOLO legacy dataset was discussed and exemplified with the analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of selected soil properties, namely the organic carbon content, pH, and cation exchange capacity. For these properties, 1km grid maps were also developed for the topsoil horizons/layers in Portugal using different spatial modelling approaches. To highlight the importance of using INFOSOLO for soil characterization, the EU-wide soil database LUCAS was used to compare both datasets in terms of data distributions, spatial continuity and accuracy of modelling outputs. The comparison also included the digital soil maps provided by the SoilGrids product for Portugal. The comparison results highlighted specific areas in the country for which INFOSOLO is capable to deliver accurate but also more reliable predictions when compared with the LUCAS and SoilGrids results. Thus, INFOSOLO provides the basis for improving soil information in the country and for raising national awareness of the importance of soil resources to the country's development.},

@article{CARRE20071,
	abstract = {Legacy soil data form an important resource for digital soil mapping and are essential for calibration of models for predicting soil properties from environmental variables. Such data arise from traditional soil survey. Methods of soil survey are generally empirical and based on the mental development of the surveyor, correlating soil with underlying geology, landforms, vegetation and air-photo interpretation. There are no statistical criteria for traditional soil sampling, and this may lead to biases in the areas being sampled. The challenge is to test the use of legacy data for large-area mapping (e.g. national or continental extents) in order to limit the funds of field survey for large-area mapping. The problem is then to assess the reliability and quality of the legacy soil databases that have been mainly populated by traditional soil survey, and if there is a possibility of additional funding for sampling, to determine where new sampling units should be located. This additional sampling can be used to improve and validate the prediction model. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) has been proposed as a sampling design for digital soil mapping when there is no prior sample. We use the principle of hypercube sampling to assess the quality of existing soil data and guide us to locations that need to be sampled. First an area is defined and the empirical environmental data layers or covariates are identified on a regular grid. The existing soil data are matched with the environmental variables. The HELS algorithm is used to check the occupancy of the legacy sampling units in the hypercube of the quantiles of the covarying environmental data. This is to determine whether legacy soil survey data occupy the hypercube uniformly or if there is over- or under-observation in the partitions of the hypercube. It also allows posterior estimation of the apparent probability of sample units being surveyed. From this information we can design further sampling. The methods are illustrated using legacy soil samples from Edgeroi, New South Wales, Australia, and from a large part of the Danube Basin. One third of the total number of sampling units are added to the original dataset. These new sampling units improve the representation of the feature space of the covariate. The standard deviation of the overall density is consequently smaller.},

@article{Hsu,
	abstract = {{Scanned documents in electronic health records (EHR) have been a challenge for decades, and are expected to stay in the foreseeable future. Current approaches for processing include image preprocessing, optical character recognition (OCR), and natural language processing (NLP). However, there is limited work evaluating the interaction of image preprocessing methods, NLP models, and document layout.We evaluated 2 key indicators for sleep apnea, Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen saturation (SaO2), from 955 scanned sleep study reports. Image preprocessing methods include gray-scaling, dilating, eroding, and contrast. OCR was implemented with Tesseract. Seven traditional machine learning models and 3 deep learning models were evaluated. We also evaluated combinations of image preprocessing methods, and 2 deep learning architectures (with and without structured input providing document layout information), with the goal of optimizing end-to-end performance.Our proposed method using ClinicalBERT reached an AUROC of 0.9743 and document accuracy of 94.76\\% for AHI, and an AUROC of 0.9523 and document accuracy of 91.61\\% for SaO2.There are multiple, inter-related steps to extract meaningful information from scanned reports. While it would be infeasible to experiment with all possible option combinations, we experimented with several of the most critical steps for information extraction, including image processing and NLP. Given that scanned documents will likely be part of healthcare for years to come, it is critical to develop NLP systems to extract key information from this data.We demonstrated the proper use of image preprocessing and document layout could be beneficial to scanned document processing.Electronic health records frequently contain scanned documents, usually the result of faxed reports from other providers. Scanned documents are a challenge to processing, being images and not text, yet they frequently contain important information. Automatically extracting information from scanned documents, therefore, not only requires normal natural language processing (NLP) methods, but also additional steps such as optical character recognition (OCR) that converts images to text. Given that scanned documents will likely be part of healthcare for years to come, it is critical to develop NLP systems to extract key information from this data. This paper evaluates a battery of methods for extracting information from sleep study reports, though the methods should generalize to many other clinical NLP tasks related to scanned documents. Specifically, we focus on 2 key indicators for sleep apnea, Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen saturation (SaO2). We experiment with several image preprocessing methods and 7 machine learning-based NLP models. Our best-performing method achieves a document-level accuracy of 94.8\\% for identifying AHI values and 91.6\\% for identifying SaO2 values. Overall, we demonstrate the proper use of image preprocessing and document layout could be beneficial to scanned document processing.}},
