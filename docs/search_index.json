Examples: We have been using bookdown for the Ocean Health Index: ohi-science.org/data-science-training and Openscapes: openscapes.org/series. And R Markdown is much more than books and websites – here’s a one-minute video about R Markdown to get you excited. 1.2 Learn all about Bookdown The best way to learn more about bookdown is from Yihui Xie himself. You can read his book bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown or watch his webinar introducing bookdown. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Benefits of a centralised data repository for soil data.", " Chapter 2 Introduction The bookdown package and book is definitely the best way to get started. However, in practice I always find myself copying an existing, working book and modifying it instead of starting from scratch. So this tutorial is going to have you do that as well, using this book as the one you copy from. [more setup here] You will have to name your book’s repository. To differentiate your book’s repo name from this “bookdown-tutorial” repo, here we’ll call your book “awesome-book” but you should consistently name it what you want to name it. 2.1 Benefits of a centralised data repository for soil data. A centralised data repository for soil data offers a multitude of benefits, spanning from enhanced accessibility and data sharing to improved data quality and informed decision-making. Accessibility: A single repository provides a unified access point for various stakeholders, including researchers, farmers, policymakers, and educators, facilitating easy retrieval of information. Centralization promotes interdisciplinary research and collaboration by making soil data accessible across different scientific and agricultural disciplines. Quality: A centralised data repository ensures that data from various sources is standardised in format, making it easier to compare and analyse and providing better control over the quality of soil data, as it can be vetted and validated through standardised protocols. Efficient Data Management: Centralised repositories provide organised storage, making it easier to manage vast amounts of soil data efficiently. Central repositories ensure long-term preservation of soil data, protecting it from loss due to localised issues like technical failures or organisational changes. Improved Data Analysis and Research: Having a centralised repository means researchers can access more comprehensive data sets, leading to more robust and inclusive research outcomes. Centralization facilitates the application of advanced data analytics, including AI and machine learning, to uncover deeper insights and patterns in soil data. Support for Policy and Decision Making: Access to comprehensive soil data aids policymakers in developing informed, evidence-based agricultural and environmental policies. This support can be crucial in managing risks related to agriculture, such as soil degradation, contamination, and climate change impacts. Enhanced Educational and Outreach Opportunities: A centralised soil data repository serves as an invaluable resource for educational institutions, enhancing learning and research opportunities for students.and it can also play a role in raising public awareness about soil health and sustainable agricultural practices. Facilitation of Digital Initiatives: Centralised data repositories are essential for digital soil mapping initiatives, providing the necessary data to create detailed and accurate soil maps. They facilitate the integration of soil data with other technological tools, like GIS and remote sensing, enhancing the scope of soil analysis and interpretation. Global Collaboration and Benchmarking: A centralised repository can serve as a platform for international collaboration, sharing best practices and data across borders. It allows for benchmarking and comparative studies at a global scale, essential for understanding and addressing global soil health issues. A centralised data repository for soil data is a powerful tool that can transform how soil information is managed and utilised. By providing a platform for standardised, high-quality, and accessible soil data, it supports a range of activities from scientific research to policy making, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and informed management of soil resources worldwide.

However, in practice I always find myself copying an existing, working book and modifying it instead of starting from scratch. So this tutorial is going to have you do that as well, using this book as the one you copy from. [more setup here] You will have to name your book’s repository. To differentiate your book’s repo name from this “bookdown-tutorial” repo, here we’ll call your book “awesome-book” but you should consistently name it what you want to name it. 3.1 Get “bookdown-tutorial” going on your local computer Go to https://github.com/jules32/bookdown-tutorial Click the green “clone or download” button and DOWNLOAD ZIP. Locally on your computer, unzip the folder, save it in a reasonable place Rename 2 things from “bookdown-tutorial” to “awesome-book”. You can do this in the finder/windows explorer: the folder itself (that you just unzipped) the .Rproj file Double-click the .Rproj file to launch RStudio Install packages and restart install.packages(\"bookdown\") install.packages(\"usethis\") Use the menu item Session &gt; Restart R Click on the Build tab in the top right pane Click on Build Book! Nice job! Now let’s make it yours, and connect it to GitHub. 3.2 Create your “awesome-book” GitHub repo Go to your GitHub account: github.com/username Click on Repositories, and the green button “New” to create a new repo Name this new repo “awesome-book” DO NOT initialize this repo with a README Click the green “create repository” button — this will take you to your new repo Click the tiny “clone or download” button near the top and COPY URL 3.3 Turn “bookdown-tutorial” into “awesome-book” The following is from Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git With R Go back to RStudio, to your “awesome-book” project In the Console, type usethis::use_git() and say Yes to the two prompts. This will restart R and give you a new Git tab in the upper right pane. Now, click on the Terminal tab next to the Console tab. Type git remote add origin &lt;paste your copied awesome-book github url here&gt; Type git push --set-upstream origin master 3.4 Publish “awesome-book” Last steps! Go back to github.com/username/“awesome-book” and refresh — our files should be there! But we want it to be a book published as https://username.github.io/awesome-book. Click Settings Scroll down to GitHub Settings Change the Source pulldown from “None” to “master branch /docs folder” It should say “Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/awesome-book/” — click the link to see! Now, you’re set — you just need to write your book. 3.5 Moving forward As you write your .Rmd files, build the book and commit all files, including the docs/ folder, and your published book will be updated!
