# Data Collection, Inclusion Criteria  and Quality Control {#datacollection}

One of the challenges with soil legacy data is its variability. The source data is often diverse, including different ranges of soil properties, formats and quality standards. This poses challenges in data integration, analysis, and interpretation. The methods used to collect this data can vary significantly, encompassing different sampling techniques, laboratory analyses, and documentation processes, affecting the comparability of the data. Legacy data might have been collected using less precise methods compared to modern techniques, leading to potential issues with accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, there can be gaps and limitations in the data, either spatially or temporally, due to historical constraints in data collection efforts, with certain areas or time periods potentially being under-represented.

Despite these challenges, soil legacy data is often rich in contextual information, including land use history, climate data, and vegetation cover, adding invaluable context to soil studies, and it is crucial for establishing baseline conditions, against which current soil properties and changes can be assessed.

The creation of a National Soil Legacy Data Repository encompasses both proper methods and processes to gather soil data - data collection, standards and requirements for data to be added to the repository - data inclusion, and for quality assessment. Establishing guidelines for the collection, inclusion and quality of soil legacy data is crucial for ensuring the data's relevance, consistency and usefulness of the repository.

There are several methods to retrieve information from legacy data. In the case that the original data is stored in the form of a digital database, its inclusion is direct even if some data harmonization is often required. However, in most of the cases, the original data is in paper format. In these cases the translation of the unstructured data in paper to a structured digital database can be done by: 
* Manual Data Entry: Operators read the documents and manually transpose the data into the system. This is highly time-consuming and it is prone to mistakes. The output data has to be doubled checked to ensure data quality and consistency.
* Semi-automated text detection: Using OCR technology.
* Use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Documents are analysed and Data is extracted using Artificial Intelligence. This method makes use of combinations of techniques such as OCR, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) [@Hsu], etc to extract and classify the information from unstructured data and reduces considerably the processing time. There are application facilitating this methodology such as Google Cloud AI.

## Data Collection Guidelines
* **Source Identification:**
   *  Collect data from reliable and verifiable sources, such as academic institutions, government agencies, and reputable research organisations.
   *  Ensure that the data collection methods and instruments used are documented and meet accepted scientific standards.
* **Data Organization:**
   *  Include information about data sources, land-use, geology and topography of the soil profile.
   *  Add an unique identifier to each soil profile in the database.
   *  Include the location coordinates and the EPSG code of the coordinate system of each soil profile.
   *  Include all soil horizons separately in the database. All horizons in the same soil profile must share the same profile ID.
   *  Include top and bottom depths of each horizon in the soil profile.
   *  Include all available soil physico-chemical properties such as colour, texture, sand, silk and clay contents, bulk density, pH, organic matter content, nutrient levels, etc.
   *  Include information about analytical methods used if available.
   *  Include the date or period of data collection for each dataset to determine the representative timeframe and to understand its historical context.
* **Methodological Consistency:**
   *  Where possible, use data collected using consistent methodologies to facilitate comparability.
   *  Document any methodological variations that could affect data interpretation.
   *  Ensure that documentation is provided whenever any of the values for the physical or chemical properties are estimated, such as when using pedotransfer functions.

## Data Inclusion Guidelines
* **Relevance:**
   *  Data should be relevant to the specific objectives of the soil legacy data repository, such as agricultural planning, environmental monitoring, or climate change studies.
* **Quality and Accuracy:**
   *  Prioritise data that has been validated and where the accuracy is known or can be reasonably estimated.
   *  Include information about any known limitations or uncertainties in the data.
* **Standardisation and Harmonization:**
   *  Data should, as far as possible, conform to standard formats and units to facilitate integration and analysis.
   *  Conversion or normalisation procedures should be applied to data that is not in standard formats.
   *  Consider Soil Layer Harmonization when preparing data for DSM analyses.
* **Completeness:**
   *  Prefer datasets that are complete or near-complete for the variables and geographical areas they cover.
   *  Document any significant gaps in the data.
* **Metadata:**
   *  Ensure that each dataset includes comprehensive metadata detailing data collection methods, geographic location, time of collection, data collector, and any processing or analysis that has been performed.
* **Legal and Ethical Considerations:**
   *  Only include data that can be legally shared and used, respecting copyright and privacy concerns.
   *  Obtain necessary permissions and adhere to data sharing and usage policies.

## Data Quality Guidelines
* **Establishment of Accuracy Thresholds:**
   *  Ensure that measured property values fall within feasible thresholds considering its soil type, land use, parent material and climatic conditions.
   *  Set acceptable ranges of variance for soil pH levels, nutrient content, and other measurable properties.
   *  When dealing with compositional data properties, such as  the relative content of sand, silt and clay, ensure that the sum of the relative values is up to 100.
* **Methodological Consistency:**
   *  Ensure consistency in the methodologies used to collect and analyse soil data across different times and locations, to maintain data accuracy.
* **Error Identification and Documentation:**
   *  Implement processes for identifying and documenting potential errors or anomalies in the data.
   *  Develop protocols for handling data that falls outside the established accuracy thresholds, or values falling under the detection limit of the measurement device.
* **Regular Data Quality Assessments:**
   *  Conduct regular audits and quality assessments of the data to ensure ongoing accuracy.
   *  Update the repository with new findings or corrections as needed.
* **Use of Statistical Methods for Validation:**
   *  Apply statistical methods to assess and confirm the accuracy of the data. This can include techniques like regression analysis, error propagation, or uncertainty quantification.
* **Metadata Requirements:**
   *  Require comprehensive metadata for each dataset, detailing the accuracy assessments, error margins, and any relevant quality control measures.

By following these guidelines, it can be ensured that the soil legacy data collected and included in the repository is of high quality, relevant, and useful for various applications.
